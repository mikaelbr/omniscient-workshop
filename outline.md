 - react intro
 - passing props
 - easy mental model

Assignments:
 - Creating components (classes)
 - Passing props to component
 - Composing components (children)
 - Render twice to update view using setTimeout.

---

Setup: 
 - react component state change causes re-render
 - state gets out of hand

Main part:

 - gains
 - immstruct
 - cursors

Assignments:

 - Check equality of structures.
 - Iterate over maps and transform data using `map`, `filter`, etc.
 - Test out creating cursors through immstruct
 - Print changes to cursors using immstruct.

Setup:
 - shouldComponentUpdate

Main part:
 - omniscient
 - rationale

Assignments:
 - Create React components with simple `shouldComponentUpdates` as mixins.
 - Creating Omniscient components, pass in a tree props (only view)
 - Creating Omniscient components with cursors as input. (only view)
 - Creating updatable omniscient components (render loop)
 - Composing components
 - Using mixins (lifecycles)?
